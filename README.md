# AVR-UTILS
Remember to add interrupts control, so you could easily change current_menu.
This is based on tutorial from: http://caladan.jogger.pl/2010/11/06/implementacja-prostego-menu-w-c-takze-dla-mikrokontrolerow/ so give this guy a credit aswell. \
I will try to write some more infos about using it but try to figure it on your own.
